This is a full stack ecommerce website build on MERN stack.
The front-end of an ecommerce website includes a user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout.
The back-end of the website includes an API with all the CRUD operations manages the server and processes requests. It's responsible for handling 
user authentication and authorization using JWT, managing the shopping cart and checkout process, and communicating with external services such as payment gateways
I'm just lacking a bit of middleware to work on. The database of an ecommerce website stores all the information about products, orders, and customers. 
It includes product data such as name, description, price, and images, as well as customer data such as name, email, address, and order history. I am currently 
working on developing an admin pannel to ease the admin's/owner's daily tasks and to make the UI more interesting.

This website incorporates various libraries such as Redux, Bootstrap, styled-components, and MUI.

Here's a link to the live website.
