A full-stack E-commerce website built on MERN stack and uses a variety of libraries such as bootstrap, axios, styled-components and MUI. Furthermore uses Redux for state management.


•The frontend includes a user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse products, add them to their cart, and checkout. 

•Created an API with all CRUD operations which manage the server and process requests. It handles user authentication and authorization using JWT, manages the shopping cart and checkout process, and communicates with external services such as payment gateways.

•The database stores all the information about products, orders, and customers.


I'm just lacking a bit of middleware to work on. I am currently working on developing an admin pannel to ease the admin's/owner's daily tasks and to make the UI more interesting.
